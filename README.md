# Financial Market & Labour Force Analysis
Conducting Financial Market and Labour Force analysis using R Studio, leveraging data visualization and statistical techniques to uncover insights and trends.


For my Financial Market Analysis project using R Studio, I downloaded the Financial Market Statistics dataset for the last 60 months from Statistics Canada (Table Reference: 10-10-0145-01). The analysis included several key tasks:

1. Average Bank Rate and Prime Rate Calculation: I calculated the average bank rate and prime rate for each 6-month period over the past five years, focusing solely on these variables to simplify the output and highlight key trends.

2. Rate Change Interval Analysis: I determined the average rate change period in days by analyzing the time intervals between consecutive rate changes, providing insights into the frequency of rate adjustments.

3. Distinct Bank Rates and Frequency: I identified unique bank rates and calculated their frequency (i.e., the number of months each rate appeared), offering a clear understanding of rate stability and variability over time.

4. Frequency-Based Arrangement: Finally, I organized the distinct bank rates data frame by frequency, ranking rates based on their repetitions for better interpretability.
