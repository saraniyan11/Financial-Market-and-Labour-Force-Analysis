# Financial Market & Labour Force Analysis
Conducting Financial Market and Labour Force analysis using R Studio, leveraging data visualization and statistical techniques to uncover insights and trends.


For my *Financial Market Analysis* project using R Studio, I downloaded the Financial Market Statistics dataset for the last 60 months from Statistics Canada (Table Reference: 10-10-0145-01). The analysis included several key tasks:

1. Average Bank Rate and Prime Rate Calculation: I calculated the average bank rate and prime rate for each 6-month period over the past five years, focusing solely on these variables to simplify the output and highlight key trends.

2. Rate Change Interval Analysis: I determined the average rate change period in days by analyzing the time intervals between consecutive rate changes, providing insights into the frequency of rate adjustments.

3. Distinct Bank Rates and Frequency: I identified unique bank rates and calculated their frequency (i.e., the number of months each rate appeared), offering a clear understanding of rate stability and variability over time.

4. Frequency-Based Arrangement: Finally, I organized the distinct bank rates data frame by frequency, ranking rates based on their repetitions for better interpretability.


In my *Labour Force Analysis* project using R Studio, I analyzed the seasonally adjusted monthly labour force characteristics dataset for individuals aged 25 to 54. The data was sourced from Statistics Canada (Table Reference: 14-10-0287-03) for the most recent month and the same month of the previous year. Key steps and insights from the project include:

1. Growth Analysis: I calculated the growth rates of population, full-time employment, part-time employment, and unemployment between the two months for Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Canada as a whole. This highlighted regional and national trends in labour market dynamics.

2. Part-Time Employment Rate Ranking: Using data from the last available month, I calculated the part-time employment rate as a percentage of the labour force for all provinces. The results were presented in descending order to identify provinces with the highest reliance on part-time employment.

3. Employment/Unemployment Rate Analysis: A data frame was generated to compare employment and unemployment rates across provinces using the most recent data. This provided insights into provincial employment opportunities, revealing variations in labour market conditions and areas with stronger or weaker employment prospects.
